# What is Crowdfund
 
Crowdfunding is a way of raising funds from a large number of people, typically through the internet. It allows individuals, businesses, or organizations to raise money from a collective effort of friends, family, customers, and even strangers. This approach to fundraising has become increasingly popular over the past decade, thanks to the rise of social media and online platforms.
