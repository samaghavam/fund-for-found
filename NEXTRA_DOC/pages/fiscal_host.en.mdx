# What is Decentralized Hosting

In the crowdfunding platforms, there is a need for creating a legal entity so that you could provide an umbrella structure for multiple 
founders to operate. However, it may gain issue as it lacks the full ownership. In 3F you could leverage Decentralized Hosting so that
founders transparently reports about their income, and the funders could track their records, without any middle entity.
