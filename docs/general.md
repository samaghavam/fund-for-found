### Creative Projects

**_This kinds of projects are in the field of Game, AI, Software Solutions (Framework, Design System, etc.) It's more like opencollective than kickstarter with focus on technology itself_**

### Sponsorship Program

**_It's more like gofundme, people could get funded by their creative work via link. it should be so easy_**

### Payment Problem

**_Payment system is the core concept of this platform. In this regard, we should provide three distinct payment system. US-based, Crypto and Payment_**

### Users First

All the expenses and transactions should be visible. So others could follow up the project.

Also, all the projects should be compeletely validate by the system admin, as there are sanctions and we do not enter to the dirty market, we should divide ourselves from these kinds of markets.

### Multiple Language

Best example of a multi language website is cafe bazar. However, it lacks all the pages.
So, as our target market for creative projects are familiar with english, we provide the platform in english,
and then, in the publishment page of the project, we ask from users that if they want to publsih it in persian, arabic and

### Language Solution Best Practice

The best practice for the lang solution is to provide a translator for the provided content
there are two types of content, `system-content` and `user-content`.
system content is easy, we just use i18n for this purpose. On the other hand, `user-content` is complicated.
We should give users the freedom to use their own preference. However, they could also add another language to their content.
but it would be complicated, because we should provide two fields for each. So, we should use translator, for generating the content
for English (like what we see in social media like linkedin or instagram).

### Conclusion

After all, its better to release the platform in English so that do not bring focus for that, but
in the near future, other languages will be added. The best possible solution is that we should convert
any language to english as a reference so that others could understand. but, users could change their target language
based on their interest, and all the materials would be converted into the target language.
